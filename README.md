# Goal
The goal of making this application was/is to learn the basics of Swift and Xcode i.e. making custom views, creating UI's, using outlets, actions and SocketIO. I want to learn Swift/Xcode because I want to be able to make apps, good apps, that people are willing to pay me to use. The great thing about software products like apps is that there is very little overhead so all I need to invest is time in order to produce a product that has the potential to make money. All in all, I want a future in tech, I want to start a business, I thought I mine as well start learning how to make and sell software.
